TODO
1. Move keyboard to bottom of screen
2. Add logic for what happens when user clicks on a key
  -Checks against given word and turns red if not there, green if is there
  -Displays all instances of correct letter on click
3. Move word above keyboard
4. Initialize word with blank underscores

Journal
1. Why not redux?
  Maybe not necessary for an application this small. Manageable without it.

2. Why switch to keyboard layout instead of user input box?
  More intuitive for user
  Potentially scale better to mobile?
  Allows for some fun styling (hover effects)
